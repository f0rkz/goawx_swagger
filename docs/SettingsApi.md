# **SettingsSettingsList**
> SettingsSettingsList(ctx, optional)
 List Settings

 Make a GET request to this resource to retrieve the list of settings.  The resulting data structure contains:      {         \"count\": 99,         \"next\": null,         \"previous\": null,         \"results\": [             ...         ]     }  The `count` field indicates the total number of settings found for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The `results` list contains zero or more setting records.    ## Results  Each setting data structure includes the following fields:  * `url`:  (string) * `slug`:  (string) * `name`:  (string)    ## Sorting  To specify that settings are returned in a particular order, use the `order_by` query string parameter on the GET request.      ?order_by=name  Prefix the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:      ?order_by=-name  Multiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with a comma `,`:      ?order_by=name,some_other_field  ## Pagination  Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve a particular page of results.      ?page_size=100&page=2  The `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these query string parameters automatically.  ## Searching  Use the `search` query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search within all designated text fields of a model.      ?search=findme  (_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search across related fields:      ?related__search=findme
