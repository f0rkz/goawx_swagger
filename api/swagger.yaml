      description: "\nThis page lists OAuth 2 utility endpoints used for authorization,\
        \ token refresh and revoke.\nNote endpoints other than `/api/o/authorize/`\
        \ are not meant to be used in browsers and do not\nsupport HTTP GET. The endpoints\
        \ here strictly follow\n[RFC specs for OAuth2](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749),\
        \ so please use that for detailed\nreference. Note AWX net location default\
        \ to `http://localhost:8013` in examples:\n\n\n## Create Token for an Application\
        \ using Authorization code grant type\nGiven an application \"AuthCodeApp\"\
        \ of grant type `authorization-code`, \nfrom the client app, the user makes\
        \ a GET to the Authorize endpoint with \n\n* `response_type`\n* `client_id`\n\
        * `redirect_uris`\n* `scope`  \n\nAWX will respond with the authorization\
        \ `code` and `state`\nto the redirect_uri specified in the application. The\
        \ client application will then make a POST to the\n`api/o/token/` endpoint\
        \ on AWX with\n\n* `code`\n* `client_id`\n* `client_secret`\n* `grant_type`\n\
        * `redirect_uri`\n\nAWX will respond with the `access_token`, `token_type`,\
        \ `refresh_token`, and `expires_in`. For more\ninformation on testing this\
        \ flow, refer to [django-oauth-toolkit](http://django-oauth-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/tutorial_01.html#test-your-authorization-server).\n\
        \n\n## Create Token for an Application using Password grant type\n\nLog in\
        \ is not required for `password` grant type, so a simple `curl` can be used\
        \ to acquire a personal access token\nvia `/api/o/token/` with \n\n* `grant_type`:\
        \ Required to be \"password\"\n* `username`\n* `password`\n* `client_id`:\
        \ Associated application must have grant_type \"password\"\n* `client_secret`\n\
        \nFor example:\n\n```bash\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\"\
        \ \\\n  -d \"grant_type=password&username=<username>&password=<password>&scope=read\"\
        \ \\\n  -u \"gwSPoasWSdNkMDtBN3Hu2WYQpPWCO9SwUEsKK22l:fI6ZpfocHYBGfm1tP92r0yIgCyfRdDQt0Tos9L8a4fNsJjQQMwp9569e\n\

        credential input sources.\n\nThe resulting data structure contains:\n\n  \
        \  {\n        \"count\": 99,\n        \"next\": null,\n        \"previous\"\
        : null,\n        \"results\": [\n            ...\n        ]\n    }\n\nThe\
        \ `count` field indicates the total number of credential input sources\nfound\
        \ for the given query.  The `next` and `previous` fields provides links to\n\
        additional results if there are more than will fit on a single page.  The\n\
        `results` list contains zero or more credential input source records.  \n\n\
        ## Results\n\nEach credential input source data structure includes the following\
        \ fields:\n\n* `id`: Database ID for this credential input source. (integer)\n\
        * `type`: Data type for this credential input source. (choice)\n* `url`: URL\
        \ for this credential input source. (string)\n* `related`: Data structure\
        \ with URLs of related resources. (object)\n* `summary_fields`: Data structure\
        \ with name/description for related resources.  The output for some objects\
        \ may be limited for performance reasons. (object)\n* `created`: Timestamp\
        \ when this credential input source was created. (datetime)\n* `modified`:\
        \ Timestamp when this credential input source was last modified. (datetime)\n\
        * `description`: Optional description of this credential input source. (string)\n\
        * `input_field_name`:  (string)\n* `metadata`:  (json)\n* `target_credential`:\
        \  (id)\n* `source_credential`:  (id)\n\n\n\n## Sorting\n\nTo specify that\
        \ credential input sources are returned in a particular\norder, use the `order_by`\
        \ query string parameter on the GET request.\n\n    ?order_by=name\n\nPrefix\
        \ the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:\n\n    ?order_by=-name\n\
        \nMultiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with\
        \ a\ncomma `,`:\n\n    ?order_by=name,some_other_field\n\n## Pagination\n\n\
        Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results\n\
        returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\n\
        a particular page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\nThe `previous`\
        \ and `next` links returned with the results will set these query\nstring\
        \ parameters automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search` query string\
        \ parameter to perform a case-insensitive search\nwithin all designated text\
        \ fields of a model.\n\n    ?search=findme\n\n(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_)\

        Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results\n\
        returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\n\
        a particular page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\nThe `previous`\
        \ and `next` links returned with the results will set these query\nstring\
        \ parameters automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search` query string\

        \ number of results\nreturned for each request.  Use the `page` query string\
        \ parameter to retrieve\na particular page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\
        \nThe `previous` and `next` links returned with the results will set these\
        \ query\nstring parameters automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search`\
        \ query string parameter to perform a case-insensitive search\nwithin all\
        \ designated text fields of a model.\n\n    ?search=findme\n\n(_Added in Ansible\

      description: "\nMake a GET request to this resource to retrieve a list of\n\
        job host summaries associated with the selected\njob.\n\nThe resulting data\
        \ structure contains:\n\n    {\n        \"count\": 99,\n        \"next\":\
        \ null,\n        \"previous\": null,\n        \"results\": [\n           \
        \ ...\n        ]\n    }\n\nThe `count` field indicates the total number of\
        \ job host summaries\nfound for the given query.  The `next` and `previous`\
        \ fields provides links to\nadditional results if there are more than will\
        \ fit on a single page.  The\n`results` list contains zero or more job host\
        \ summary records.  \n\n## Results\n\nEach job host summary data structure\
        \ includes the following fields:\n\n* `id`: Database ID for this job host\
        \ summary. (integer)\n* `type`: Data type for this job host summary. (choice)\n\

        \ with name/description for related resources.  The output for some objects\
        \ may be limited for performance reasons. (object)\n* `created`: Timestamp\
        \ when this job host summary was created. (datetime)\n* `modified`: Timestamp\
        \ when this job host summary was last modified. (datetime)\n* `job`:  (id)\n\
        * `host`:  (id)\n* `host_name`:  (string)\n* `changed`:  (integer)\n* `dark`:\
        \  (integer)\n* `failures`:  (integer)\n* `ok`:  (integer)\n* `processed`:\

        \  (integer)\n* `rescued`:  (integer)\n\n\n\n## Sorting\n\nTo specify that\
        \ job host summaries are returned in a particular\norder, use the `order_by`\
        \ query string parameter on the GET request.\n\n    ?order_by=name\n\nPrefix\
        \ the field name with a dash `-` to sort in reverse:\n\n    ?order_by=-name\n\
        \nMultiple sorting fields may be specified by separating the field names with\
        \ a\ncomma `,`:\n\n    ?order_by=name,some_other_field\n\n## Pagination\n\n\
        Use the `page_size` query string parameter to change the number of results\n\
        returned for each request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\n\

        \ for some objects may be limited for performance reasons. (object)\n* `created`:\
        \ Timestamp when this organization was created. (datetime)\n* `modified`:\
        \ Timestamp when this organization was last modified. (datetime)\n* `name`:\
        \ Name of this organization. (string)\n* `description`: Optional description\
        \ of this organization. (string)\n* `max_hosts`: Maximum number of hosts allowed\

        \ are returned in a particular\norder, use the `order_by` query string parameter\
        \ on the GET request.\n\n    ?order_by=name\n\nPrefix the field name with\
        \ a dash `-` to sort in reverse:\n\n    ?order_by=-name\n\nMultiple sorting\
        \ fields may be specified by separating the field names with a\ncomma `,`:\n\
        \n    ?order_by=name,some_other_field\n\n## Pagination\n\nUse the `page_size`\
        \ query string parameter to change the number of results\nreturned for each\
        \ request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\na particular\
        \ page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\nThe `previous` and `next`\
        \ links returned with the results will set these query\nstring parameters\
        \ automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search` query string parameter\
        \ to perform a case-insensitive search\nwithin all designated text fields\
        \ of a model.\n\n    ?search=findme\n\n(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search\

        \ fit on a single page.  The\n`results` list contains zero or more user records.\
        \  \n\n## Results\n\nEach user data structure includes the following fields:\n\
        \n* `id`: Database ID for this user. (integer)\n* `type`: Data type for this\
        \ user. (choice)\n* `url`: URL for this user. (string)\n* `related`: Data\
        \ structure with URLs of related resources. (object)\n* `summary_fields`:\
        \ Data structure with name/description for related resources.  The output\
        \ for some objects may be limited for performance reasons. (object)\n* `created`:\
        \ Timestamp when this user was created. (datetime)\n* `modified`: Timestamp\
        \ when this user was last modified. (datetime)\n* `username`: Required. 150\
        \ characters or fewer. Letters, digits and @/./+/-/_ only. (string)\n* `first_name`:\
        \  (string)\n* `last_name`:  (string)\n* `email`:  (string)\n* `is_superuser`:\

        \ a dash `-` to sort in reverse:\n\n    ?order_by=-username\n\nMultiple sorting\
        \ fields may be specified by separating the field names with a\ncomma `,`:\n\
        \n    ?order_by=username,some_other_field\n\n## Pagination\n\nUse the `page_size`\
        \ query string parameter to change the number of results\nreturned for each\
        \ request.  Use the `page` query string parameter to retrieve\na particular\
        \ page of results.\n\n    ?page_size=100&page=2\n\nThe `previous` and `next`\
        \ links returned with the results will set these query\nstring parameters\
        \ automatically.\n\n## Searching\n\nUse the `search` query string parameter\
        \ to perform a case-insensitive search\nwithin all designated text fields\
        \ of a model.\n\n    ?search=findme\n\n(_Added in Ansible Tower 3.1.0_) Search\
